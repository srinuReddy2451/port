<p>Currently studying in the final year at <a href="https://lbrce.ac.in/">Lakireddy Bali Reddy College of Engineering, Mylavaram</a>, one of the premier engineering institutions in the region.</p>

<p>Recently, I completed my internship at <a href="https://www.nitw.ac.in/">NIT Warangal</a>, where I worked on exciting projects involving Blockchain and IoT. This experience not only deepened my understanding of these cutting-edge technologies but also instilled in me a sense of innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>As a programmer, I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that code can create. I'm proficient in a range of programming languages, including Java,python,c and full stack developer and more over that i love bussiness analysis . I'm always looking to expand my skill set and take on new challenges.</p>
